# NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. 
It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays, matrices, and a vast collection of mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.

Key Features of NumPy:-

	1. N-dimensional array (ndarray): Efficiently handles large datasets.

	2. Mathematical functions: Linear algebra, statistical operations, Fourier transforms, etc.

	3. Broadcasting: Allows operations on arrays of different shapes.

	4. Performance: Uses optimized C and Fortran libraries for speed.

	5. Integration: Works well with SciPy, Pandas, and other scientific libraries.
